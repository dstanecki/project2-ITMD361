				<h1>About Me</h1>
						<p>My name is Daniel Stanecki. I'm 19 years old and currently in my second year at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I grew up in Evergreen Park, a suburb just south of Chicago, alongside two sisters and one brother.</p>

						<p>My major is Applied Cybersecurity & Information Technology. Growing up, I never had much experience with computers or other tech, but soon enough I learned to appreciate what it has to offer. I started with computer science classes in high school, which eventually directed me to choosing the major that I have.</p>
						<p>Career-wise, I have had experience with three retail jobs. Most recently I was working at a Mariano's in the south loop (pictured below), but I quit to pursue things that might help me advance my career development. I am hoping to land an internship within the information technology field.</p>
